# Hey, I'm Arkadiusz Sarach 👋

**Building practical business solutions with AI-powered development tools.**

---

## About me

I come from a non-traditional tech background — mining education, years in logistics and transport where I grew from a driver to a branch supervisor in a gastro-courier company. That path taught me problem-solving, managing people, and getting things done under pressure.

I completed [CodersLab's JavaScript Developer + React course](https://coderslab.pl/pl/javascript-developer-react) and since then I've been steadily expanding my skillset. Currently I'm focused on **AI-assisted development** — using tools like **Claude Code** to build real business solutions faster and smarter.

## 🔧 What I'm doing now

- 🤖 Learning and applying **AI development tools** (Claude Code, LLM-powered workflows)
- 💡 Creating **practical business solutions** — automating processes, building apps that solve real problems
- 🐍 Developing backend skills in **Python**
- ⚛️ Building frontends with **React / Next.js**
