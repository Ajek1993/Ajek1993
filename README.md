# Arkadiusz Sarach 

Hi there! :handshake:
My name is Arkadiusz and I am beginner frontend developer.

##  :wave:  About
A miner by education. However, last years I was working in logistics and transport. I started as usual driver, after 2 years I started working as branch supervisor in a gastro-courier company. I completed [CodersLab's course](https://coderslab.pl/pl/javascript-developer-react)  that delved deep into the latest React, JavaScript features and Node.js. Right now I am developing skills in React and Typescript.
